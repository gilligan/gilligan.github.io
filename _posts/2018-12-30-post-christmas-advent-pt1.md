This year, for the first time, I tried to follow the annual [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2018/)
coding challenge series. In case you haven't heard about it, here is an excerpt from its about page:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

It began with nice little puzzles but pretty quickly accelerated into something that was impossible for
me to accomodate with my family and working life. The fact that there is a 2-part challenge each day also demotivated me
as I fell behind further and further until I just could not be bothered anymore. The aim of this
blog post however is not to complain about the format of _Advent of Code_ - after all it did work out
just fine for a lot of people. What I intend to do instead is to take it
nice and easy and tackle some of the challenges whenever I have time and invite you to follow along.

Depending on how far I will be able to take this, it is entirely possible that I will get stuck. Fortunately
I know a lot of people that are more experienced with Haskell than I am, so in that case I will just reach
out and share what I learned. Beyond that even, I could try to talk some of them into writing a guest blog
post :)
