Hey, my name is *Tobi*! Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I live in South Germany together with my wonderful family
and for the past _14+_ years I have been working as a Software Engineer, Consultant and Engineering Manager in the IT industry.

## Working With People, Teams And Individuals

My main interest is to work with people, both individually and on a team level to help identify problems, support with the solutions and macreate value in a sustainable manner in a psychologically safe environment. I strive to be a [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership), I don't crack the whip to get teams to perform, instead I work to create alignment and shared understanding around value and performance in the context of a team's remit.

- **Agile**: I believe in [_"individuals and interactions over processes and tools"_](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and apply this in my work.
- **Hiring**: I have gathered a lot of experience as Hiring Manager in different companies and care deeply about creating and conducting hiring processes and interviews that are actually effective by being fair, transparent and inclusive.
- **On-boarding**: During my time at HolidayCheck I co-created and lead the [HolidayCheck Apprenticeship Program](http://apprenticeship.holidaycheck.com/). On-boarding and continued mentoring of employees is as rewarding to the individual as it is beneficial to the company, and I wish more companies would embrace the apprenticeship model.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Wherever I work, I try to foster a culture of knowledge sharing. This ranges from regular on-line pairing/programming or lightning talk sessions to organizing team off-site events that focus on a specific topic.
- **Facilitation**: I enjoy facilitating meetings and events for groups of 3-6 people (planning meetings, retrospectives, post-mortems etc) up to 70 people and beyond (Engineering off-site, [Open Space Conferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) etc)

## Things I Care About At Work

- A diverse and healthy working culture where toxic behavior isn't tolerated.
- [Egoless Programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)
- [Focusing on the bottleneck](https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/03/the-theory-of-constraints-in-agile/)
- [The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)
- Testing -- because strong static typing is _not_ good enough.

## Tools & Technologies

Over the years I have worked with a wide range of tools and technologies:

- Functional Programming (Haskell and friends)
- Nix/NixOS & Immutable Infrastructure
- CI/CD (Docker, AWS, GCE, Jenkins, ...)
- Frontend Development (JS)
- Microservices
- Lots of Shell Scripts
- Embedded C / Assembler
- GUI Toolkits (Qt/C++)
- Enterprise Java (Spring and friends)


## What Else?

Some other things worth mentioning about myself

- I enjoy facilitating events (for example [NixCon 2018](https://nixcon2018.org/)).
- I am the organizer of [BusConf](https://www.bus-conf.org) - A FP oriented OpenSpace conference.
- I occasionally speak at conferences ([haskellX 2019: Nix workshop](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/14175-workshop-nix-and-haskell-from-hello-world-to-deploying-to-production)).
- I've helped out in the haskellX program committee which was a really nice experience.
- You can have a look at my [CV](https://tpflug.me/cv.pdf) if you want to.
